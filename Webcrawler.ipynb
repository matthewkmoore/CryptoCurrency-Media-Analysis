       "\"\\n\\n\\n\\nbitcoin () is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name satoshi nakamoto. the currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as opensource software.ch. 1 bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peertopeer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\\n\\nbitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. they can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services, but the realworld value of the coins is extremely volatile. research produced by the university of cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin. users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for money laundering and price manipulation).\\n\\nbitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. some economists and commentators have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.\\n\\nthe domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 august 2008. on 31 october 2008, a link to a paper authored by satoshi nakamoto titled bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system was posted to a cryptography mailing list. nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as opensource code and released it in january 2009. nakamoto's identity remains unknown.\\n\\non 3 january 2009, the bitcoin network was created when nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text the times 03jan2009 chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. this note references a headline published by the times and has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractionalreserve banking.18\\n\\nthe receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk hal finney, who had created the first reusable proofofwork system (rpow) in 2004. finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 january 2009 received ten bitcoins from nakamoto. other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors wei dai, creator of bmoney, and nick szabo, creator of bit gold. in 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer laszlo hanyecz bought two papa john's pizzas for 10,000.\\n\\nblockchain analysts estimate that nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to gavin andresen. andresen later became lead developer at the bitcoin foundation. andresen then sought to decentralize control. this left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin, in contrast to the perceived authority of nakamoto's contributions.\\n\\nafter early proofofconcept transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as silk road. during its 30 months of existence, beginning in february 2011, silk road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting 9.9 million in bitcoins, worth about 214

blockchains operated simultaneously for six hours, each with its own version of the transaction history from the moment of the split. normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software, selecting the backwardscompatible version of the blockchain. as a result, this blockchain became the longest chain and could be accepted by all

signatures.101\\n\\nthe unit of account of the bitcoin system is a bitcoin. ticker symbols used to represent bitcoin are btc and xbt.2 its unicode character is . small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mbtc), and satoshi (sat). named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a satoshi is the smallest amount within bitcoin representing 1100000000 bitcoins, one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. a millibitcoin equals 11000 bitcoins one thousandth of a bitcoin or 100,000 satoshis.\\n\\nthe bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. it is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block of the chain. a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software maintains the blockchain.215219 transactions of the form payer x sends y bitcoins to payee z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications.\\n\\nnetwork nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. to achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain. at varying intervals of time averaging to every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight. this allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin was spent, which is needed to prevent doublespending. a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, but the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions.ch. 5\\n\\nindividual blocks, public addresses and transactions within blocks can be examined using a blockchain explorer.citation needed\\n\\ntransactions are defined using a forthlike scripting language.ch. 5 transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. when a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. to prevent double spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain. the use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. as in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. in such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer. any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.\\n\\nthough transaction fees are optional, miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees. miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee. these fees are generally measured in satoshis per byte (satb). the size of transactions is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction, and the number of outputs.ch. 8\\n\\nin the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. this computation can be done in a split second. but the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is practically unfeasible.ch. 4 users can tell others or make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a keypair that is already in use and has funds. the vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. to be able to spend their bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding private key and digitally sign the transaction. the network verifies the signature using the public key the private key is never revealed.ch. 5\\n\\nif the private key is lost, the bitcoin network will not recognize any other evidence of ownership the coins are then unusable, and effectively lost. for example, in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth 7.5 million at the time, when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing his private key. about 20 of all bitcoins are believed to be lost they would have had a market value of about 20 billion at july 2018 prices.\\n\\nto ensure the security of bitcoins, the private key must be kept secret.ch. 10 if the private key is revealed to a third party, e.g. through a data breach, the third party can use it to steal any associated bitcoins. as of december\\xa02017, around 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nregarding ownership distribution, as of 16 march 2018, 0.5 of bitcoin wallets own 87 of all bitcoins ever mined.\\n\\nmining is a recordkeeping service done through the use of computer processing power. miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes. each block contains a sha256 cryptographic hash of the previous block, thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name.ch. 7\\n\\nto be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a proofofwork (pow). the system used is based on adam back's 1997 antispam scheme, hashcash.failed verification the pow requires miners to find a number called a nonce, such that when the block content is hashed along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target.ch. 8 this proof is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely timeconsuming to generate, as for a secure cryptographic hash, miners must try many different nonce values (usually the sequence of tested values is the ascending natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ...ch. 8) before meeting the difficulty target.\\n\\nevery 2,016 blocks (approximately 14 days at roughly 10 min per block), the difficulty target is adjusted based on the network's recent performance, with the aim of keeping the average time between new blocks at ten minutes. in this way the system automatically adapts to the total amount of mining power on the network.ch. 8 between 1 march 2014 and 1 march 2015, the average number of nonces miners had to try before creating a new block increased from 16.4 quintillion to 200.5 quintillion.\\n\\nthe proofofwork system, alongside the chaining of blocks, makes modifications of the blockchain extremely hard, as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted. as new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called confirmations of the given block) increases.\\n\\nthe successful miner finding the new block is allowed by the rest of the network to reward themselves with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees. as of 11\\xa0may\\xa02020, the reward amounted to 6.25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the blockchain, plus any transaction fees from payments processed by the block. to mine half of the supply of bitcoins took four years but the remainder will take another 120 years, because of an artificial process called bitcoin halving according to which miners are compensated by fewer btc as time goes on. to claim the reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments.ch. 8 all bitcoins in existence have been created in such coinbase transactions. the bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). eventually, the reward will decrease to zero, and the limit of 21 million bitcoins will be reached c. 2140 the record keeping will then be rewarded solely by transaction fees.\\n\\nin other words, nakamoto set a monetary policy based on artificial scarcity at bitcoin's inception that the total number of bitcoins could never exceed 21\\xa0million. new bitcoins are created roughly every ten minutes and the rate at which they are generated drops by half about every four years until all will be in circulation.\\n\\ncomputing power is often bundled together or pooled to reduce variance in miner income. individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. in a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. this payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block.\\n\\na wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. while wallets are often described as a place to hold or store bitcoins, due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. a wallet is more correctly defined as something that stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings and allows one to access (and spend) them.ch. 1, glossary bitcoin uses publickey cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated. at its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.\\n\\nthere are several modes which wallets can operate in. they have an inverse relationship with regards to trustlessness and computational requirements.\\n\\nthirdparty internet services called online wallets offer similar functionality but may be easier to use. in this case, credentials to access funds are stored with the online wallet provider rather than on the user's hardware. as a result, the user must have complete trust in the online wallet provider. a malicious provider or a breach in server security may cause entrusted bitcoins to be stolen. an example of such a security breach occurred with mt. gox in 2011.\\n\\nphysical wallets store the credentials necessary to spend bitcoins offline and can be as simple as a paper printout of the private keych. 10 a paper wallet. a paper wallet is created with a keypair generated on a computer with no internet connection the private key is written or printed onto the paper and then erased from the computer. the paper wallet can then be stored in a safe physical location for later retrieval. bitcoins stored using a paper wallet are said to be in cold storage.39\\n\\ncameron and tyler winklevoss, the founders of the gemini trust co. exchange, reported that they had cut their paper wallets into pieces and stored them in envelopes distributed to safe deposit boxes across the united states. through this system, the theft of one envelope would neither allow the thief to steal any bitcoins nor deprive the rightful owners of their access to them.\\n\\nphysical wallets can also take the form of metal token coins with a private key accessible under a security hologram in a recess struck on the reverse side.38 the security hologram selfdestructs when removed from the token, showing that the private key has been accessed. originally, these tokens were struck in brass and other base metals, but later used precious metals as bitcoin grew in value and popularity.80 coins with stored face value as high as 1000 have been struck in gold.102104 the british museum's coin collection includes four specimens from the earliest series83 of funded bitcoin tokens one is currently on display in the museum's money gallery. in 2013, a utahn manufacturer of these tokens was ordered by the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) to register as a money services business before producing any more funded bitcoin tokens.80\\n\\nanother type of physical wallet called a hardware wallet keeps credentials offline while facilitating transactions. the hardware wallet acts as a computer peripheral and signs transactions as requested by the user, who must press a button on the wallet to confirm that they intended to make the transaction. hardware wallets never expose their private keys, keeping bitcoins in cold storage even when used with computers that may be compromised by malware.4245\\n\\nthe first wallet program, simply named bitcoin, and sometimes referred to as the satoshi client, was released in 2009 by satoshi nakamoto as opensource software. in version 0.5 the client moved from the wxwidgets user interface toolkit to qt, and the whole bundle was referred to as bitcoinqt. after the release of version 0.9, the software bundle was renamed bitcoin core to distinguish itself from the underlying network.\\n\\nbitcoin core is, perhaps, the best known implementation or client. alternative clients (forks of bitcoin core) exist, such as bitcoin xt, bitcoin unlimited, and parity bitcoin.\\n\\non 1 august 2017, bitcoin cash was created as result of a hard fork. bitcoin cash has a larger block size limit and had an identical blockchain at the time of fork. on 24 october 2017 another hard fork, bitcoin gold, was created. bitcoin gold changes the proofofwork algorithm used in mining, as the developers felt that mining had become too specialized.\\n\\nbitcoin is decentralized thus\\n\\nresearchers have pointed out at a trend towards centralization. although bitcoin can be sent directly from user to user, in practice intermediaries are widely used.220222 bitcoin miners join large mining pools to minimize the variance of their income.215, 2192223 because transactions on the network are confirmed by miners, decentralization of the network requires that no single miner or mining pool obtains 51 of the hashing power, which would allow them to doublespend coins, prevent certain transactions from being verified and prevent other miners from earning income. as of 2013 just six mining pools controlled 75 of overall bitcoin hashing power. in 2014 mining pool ghash.io obtained 51 hashing power which raised significant controversies about the safety of the network. the pool has voluntarily capped their hashing power at 39.99 and requested other pools to act responsibly for the benefit of the whole network. c.\\u20092017 over 70 of the hashing power and 90 of transactions were operating from china.\\n\\naccording to researchers, other parts of the ecosystem are also controlled by a small set of entities, notably the maintenance of the client software, online wallets and simplified payment verification (spv) clients.\\n\\nbitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that funds are not tied to realworld entities but rather bitcoin addresses. owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. in addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through idioms of use (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses. additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information. to heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction.\\n\\nwallets and similar software technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of fungibility. researchers have pointed out that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's fungibility. for example, in 2012, mt. gox froze accounts of users who deposited bitcoins that were known to have just been stolen.\\n\\nthe blocks in the blockchain were originally limited to 32 megabytes in size. the block size limit of one megabyte was introduced by satoshi nakamoto in 2010. eventually the block size limit of one megabyte created problems for transaction processing, such as increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions. andreas antonopoulos has stated lightning network is a potential scaling solution and referred to lightning as a second layer routing network.ch. 8\\n\\nsatoshi nakamoto stated in his white paper that the root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. the central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\\n\\naccording to the european central bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the austrian school of economics, especially with friedrich von hayek in his book denationalisation of money the argument refined, in which hayek advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.22\\n\\naccording to the new york times, libertarians and anarchists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin. early bitcoin supporter roger ver said at first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. we saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state. the economist describes bitcoin as a technoanarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks. economist paul krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are something of a cult based in paranoid fantasies of government power.\\n\\n nigel dodd argues in the social life of bitcoin that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control. dodd quotes a youtube video, with roger ver, jeff berwick, charlie shrem, andreas antonopoulos, gavin wood, trace meyer and other proponents of bitcoin reading the declaration of bitcoin's independence. the declaration includes a message of cryptoanarchism with the words bitcoin is inherently antiestablishment, antisystem, and antistate. bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian.\\n\\ndavid golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from rightwing extremist movements such as the liberty lobby and the john birch society and their anticentral bank rhetoric, or, more recently, ron paul and tea partystyle libertarianism. steve bannon, who owns a good stake in bitcoin, considers it to be disruptive populism. it takes control back from central authorities. it's revolutionary.\\n\\na 2014 study of google trends data found correlations between bitcoinrelated searches and ones related to computer programming and illegal activity, but not libertarianism or investment topics.\\n\\nbitcoin is a digital asset designed to work in peertopeer transactions as a currency. bitcoins have three qualities useful in a currency, according to the economist in january 2015 they are hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify. per some researchers, as of 2015, bitcoin functions more as a payment system than as a currency.\\n\\neconomists define money as serving the following three purposes a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. according to the economist in 2014, bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange. however, this is debated, and a 2018 assessment by the economist stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria.\\nyale economist robert j. shiller writes that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods, as with chile's unidad de fomento, but that bitcoin in its present form ... doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem.\\n\\naccording to research by cambridge university, between 2.9 million and 5.8 million unique users used a cryptocurrency wallet in 2017, most of them for bitcoin. the number of users has grown significantly since 2013, when there were 300,0001.3 million users.\\n\\nthe overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions take place on a cryptocurrency exchange, rather than being used in transactions with merchants. delays processing payments through the blockchain of about ten minutes make bitcoin use very difficult in a retail setting. prices are not usually quoted in units of bitcoin and many trades involve one, or sometimes two, conversions into conventional currencies. merchants that do accept bitcoin payments may use payment service providers to perform the conversions.\\n\\nin 2017 and 2018 bitcoin's acceptance among major online retailers included only three of the top 500 u.s. online merchants, down from five in 2016. reasons for this decline include high transaction fees due to bitcoin's scalability issues and long transaction times.\\n\\nbloomberg reported that the largest 17 crypto merchantprocessing services handled 69 million in june 2018, down from 411 million in september 2017. bitcoin is not actually usable for retail transactions because of high costs and the inability to process chargebacks, according to nicholas weaver, a researcher quoted by bloomberg. high price volatility and transaction fees make paying for small retail purchases with bitcoin impractical, according to economist kim grauer. however, bitcoin continues to be used for largeitem purchases on sites such as overstock.com, and for crossborder payments to freelancers and other vendors.\\n\\nbitcoins can be bought on digital currency exchanges.\\n\\nper researchers, there is little sign of bitcoin use in international remittances despite high fees charged by banks and western union who compete in this market. the south china morning post, however, mentions the use of bitcoin by hong kong workers to transfer money home.\\n\\nin 2014, the national australia bank closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin, and hsbc refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin. australian banks in general have been reported as closing down bank accounts of operators of businesses involving the currency.\\n\\non 10 december 2017, the chicago board options exchange started trading bitcoin futures, followed by the chicago mercantile exchange, which started trading bitcoin futures on 17 december 2017.\\n\\nin september 2019 the central bank of venezuela, at the request of pdvsa, ran tests to determine if bitcoin and ether could be held in central bank's reserves. the request was motivated by oil company's goal to pay its suppliers.\\n\\nthe winklevoss twins have purchased bitcoin. in 2013, the washington post reported a claim

30,000 bitcoins, at the time called mystery buyer. the company's goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 23 years with 10,000 to 20,000 for a 6 stake. investors also invest in bitcoin mining. according to a 2015 study by paolo tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost 1 billion in three years (q1 2012  q1 2015).\\n\\nthe price of bitcoins has gone through cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles and busts. in 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about us0.30 to us32 before returning to us2. in the latter half of 2012 and during the 201213 cypriot financial crisis, the bitcoin price began to rise, reaching a high of us266 on 10 april 2013, before crashing to around us50. on 29 november 2013, the cost of one bitcoin rose to a peak of us1,242. in 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of april remained depressed at little more than half 2013 prices. as of august\\xa02014 it was under us600.\\n\\naccording to mark t. williams, as of 30\\xa0september\\xa02014, bitcoin has volatility seven times greater than gold, eight times greater than the sp 500, and 18 times greater than the us dollar. hodl is a meme created in reference to holding (as opposed to selling) during periods of volatility. unusual for an asset, bitcoin weekend trading during december 2020 was higher than for weekdays. hedge funds (using high leverage and derivates) have attempted to use the volatility to profit from downward price movements. at the end of january 2021, such positions were over 1 billion, their highest of all time.\\nas of 8\\xa0february\\xa02021, the closing price of bitcoin equals us44,797.\\n\\nbecause of bitcoin's decentralized nature and its trading on online exchanges located in many countries, regulation of bitcoin has been difficult. however, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peertopeer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban. the legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.\\n\\naccording to the library of congress, an absolute ban on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in nine countries algeria, bolivia, egypt, iraq, morocco, nepal, pakistan, vietnam, and the united arab emirates. an implicit ban applies in another 15 countries, which include bahrain, bangladesh, china, colombia, the dominican republic, indonesia, kuwait, lesotho, lithuania, macau, oman, qatar, saudi arabia and taiwan.\\n\\nin october 2020, the islamic republic news agency announced pending regulations that would require bitcoin miners in iran to sell bitcoin to the central bank of iran, and the central bank would use it for imports. iran, as of october 2020, had issued over 1,000 bitcoin mining licenses. the iranian government initially took a stance against cryptocurrency, but later changed it after seeing that digital currency could be used to circumvent sanctions. the us office of foreign assets control listed two iranians and their bitcoin addresses as part of its specially designated nationals and blocked persons list for their role in the 2018 atlanta cyberattack whose ransom was paid in bitcoin.\\n\\nthe u.s. commodity futures trading commission has issued four customer advisories for bitcoin and related investments. a july 2018 warning emphasized that trading in any cryptocurrency is often speculative, and there is a risk of theft from hacking, and fraud. in may 2014 the u.s. securities and exchange commission warned that investments involving bitcoin might have high rates of fraud, and that investors might be solicited on social media sites. an earlier investor alert warned about the use of bitcoin in ponzi schemes.\\n\\nthe european banking authority issued a warning in 2013 focusing on the lack of regulation of bitcoin, the chance that exchanges would be hacked, the volatility of bitcoin's price, and general fraud. finra and the north american securities administrators association have both issued investor alerts about bitcoin.\\n\\nan official investigation into bitcoin traders was reported in may 2018. the u.s. justice department launched an investigation into possible price manipulation, including the techniques of spoofing and wash trades.\\n\\nthe u.s. federal investigation was prompted by concerns of possible manipulation during futures settlement dates. the final settlement price of cme bitcoin futures is determined by prices on four exchanges, bitstamp, coinbase, itbit and kraken. following the first delivery date in january 2018, the cme requested extensive detailed trading information but several of the exchanges refused to provide it and later provided only limited data. the commodity futures trading commission then subpoenaed the data from the exchanges.\\n\\nstate and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the north american securities administrators association, are investigating bitcoin scams and icos in 40 jurisdictions.\\n\\nacademic research published in the journal of monetary economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the mt gox bitcoin theft and that the market remains vulnerable to manipulation. the history of hacks, fraud and theft involving bitcoin dates back to at least 2011.\\n\\nresearch by john m. griffin and amin shams in 2018 suggests that trading associated with increases in the amount of the tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the bitfinex exchange account for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017.\\n\\nj.l. van der velde, ceo of both bitfinex and tether, denied the claims of price manipulation bitfinex nor tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of bitcoin or any other cointoken on bitfinex.\\n\\nthe bank for international settlements summarized several criticisms of bitcoin in chapter v of their 2018 annual report. the criticisms include the lack of stability in bitcoin's price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners.\\n\\nfranois r. velde, senior economist at the chicago fed, described bitcoin as an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency. david andolfatto, vice president at the federal reserve bank of st. louis, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the federal reserve system and other central banks, because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies.33\\n\\nbitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight nobel memorial prize in economic sciences laureates at various times, including robert shiller on 1 march 2014, joseph stiglitz on 29 november 2017, and richard thaler on 21 december 2017. on 29 january 2018, a noted keynesian economist paul krugman has described bitcoin as a bubble wrapped in technomysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology, on 2 february 2018, professor nouriel roubini of new york university has called bitcoin the mother of all bubbles, and on 27 april 2018, a university of chicago economist james heckman has compared it to the 17thcentury tulip mania.\\n\\nbitcoin has been criticized for the amount of electricity consumed by mining.\\n\\nas of 2015,  estimated combined electricity consumption attributed to mining was 166.7 megawatts and by 2017, was estimated to be between one and four gigawatts of electricity. in 2018, bitcoin was estimated by to use 2.55 to 3.572 gw, or around 6 of the total power consumed by the global banking sector. in july 2019 bbc reported bitcoin consumes about 7 gigawatts, 0.2 of the global total, or equivalent to that of switzerland. a 2021 estimate from the university of cambridge suggests bitcoin consumes more than 178 (twh) annually, ranking it in the top 30 energy consumers if it were a country.\\n\\nbitcoin is mined in places like iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and cooling arctic air is free. bitcoin miners are known to use hydroelectric power in tibet, quebec, washington (state), and austria to reduce electricity costs. miners are attracted to suppliers such as hydro quebec that have energy surpluses.\\n\\naccording to a university of cambridge study, much of bitcoin mining is done in china, where electricity is subsidized by the government. a significant part of bitcoin mining is powered by cheap electricity in xinjiang, which mostly comes from coal power. in april 2021 a coal mine explosion in the province coincided with a 35 drop in hashing power and a flash crash in price. in other provinces, such as hunan and sichuan, mining farms use more hydropower, however these account for at most 4 of hash power. according to alex de vries, renewable energy is not a good match for bitcoin mining as 247 operations are best for roi on mining devices.\\n\\nconcerns about bitcoin's environmental impact relate bitcoin's energy consumption to carbon emissions. the difficulty of translating the energy consumption into carbon emissions lies in the decentralized nature of bitcoin impeding the localization of miners to examine the electricity mix used. the results of recent studies analyzing bitcoin's carbon footprint vary. a study published in nature climate change in 2018 claims that bitcoin could alone produce enough co2 emissions to push warming above 2\\xa0c within less than three decades. however, other researchers criticized this analysis, arguing the underlying scenarios were inadequate, leading to overestimations. according to studies published in joule and american chemical society in 2019, bitcoin's annual energy consumption results in annual carbon emission ranging from 17 to 22.9\\xa0mtco2 which is comparable to the level of emissions of countries as jordan and sri lanka or kansas city. international energy agency estimates bitcoinrelated annual carbon emissions to be likely in a range from 10 to 20\\xa0mtco2 and characterizes the predictions in nature climate change as just sensational predictions about bitcoin echoing the warnings from late 1990s about internet and its increasing energy consumption.\\n\\njournalists, economists, investors, and the central bank of estonia have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. in april 2013, eric posner, a law professor at the university of chicago, stated that a real ponzi scheme takes fraud bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion. a july 2014 report by the world bank concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate ponzi scheme.7 in june 2014, the swiss federal council examined concerns that bitcoin might be a pyramid scheme, and concluded that since in the case of bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.21\\n\\nbitcoin held at exchanges are vulnerable to theft through phishing, scamming, and hacking. as of december\\xa02017, around 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nthe use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law enforcement, and the media. bitcoin gained early notoriety for its use on the silk road. the u.s. senate held a hearing on virtual currencies in november 2013. the u.s. government claimed that bitcoin was used to facilitate payments related to russian interference in the 2016 united states elections. however, a 2021 study led by former cia director michael morell showed that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.\\n\\nseveral news outlets have asserted that the popularity of bitcoins hinges on the ability to use them to purchase illegal goods. nobelprize winning economist joseph stiglitz says that bitcoin's anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes.\\n\\nin 2014, researchers at the university of kentucky found robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in bitcoin, and find limited or no support for political and investment motives. australian researchers have estimated that 25 of all bitcoin users and 44 of all bitcoin transactions are associated with illegal activity as of april\\xa02017. there were an estimated 24 million bitcoin users primarily using bitcoin for illegal activity. they held 8 billion worth of bitcoin, and made 36 million transactions valued at 72 billion.\\n\\nbitcoin core is free and opensource software that serves as a bitcoin node (the set of which form the bitcoin network) and provides a bitcoin wallet which fully verifies payments. it is considered to be bitcoin's reference implementation. initially, the software was published by satoshi nakamoto under the name bitcoin, and later renamed to bitcoin core to distinguish it from the network. it is also known as the satoshi client.\\n\\nthe mit digital currency initiative funds some of the development of bitcoin core. the project also maintains the cryptography library libsecp256k1.\\n\\nbitcoin core includes a transaction verification engine and connects to the bitcoin network as a full node. moreover, a cryptocurrency wallet, which can be used to transfer funds, is included by default.  the wallet allows for the sending and receiving of bitcoins. it does not facilitate the buying or selling of bitcoin. it allows users to generate qr codes to receive payment.\\n\\nthe software validates the entire blockchain, which includes all bitcoin transactions ever. this distributed ledger which has reached more than 235 gigabytes in size as of jan 2019, must be downloaded or synchronized before full participation of the client may occur. although the complete blockchain is not needed all at once since it is possible to run in pruning mode. a command linebased daemon with a jsonrpc interface, bitcoind, is bundled with bitcoin core. it also provides access to testnet, a global testing environment that imitates the bitcoin main network using an alternative blockchain where valueless test bitcoins are used. regtest or regression test mode creates a private blockchain which is used as a local testing environment. finally, bitcoincli, a simple program which allows users to send rpc commands to bitcoind, is also included.\\n\\ncheckpoints which have been hard coded into the client are used only to prevent denial of service attacks against nodes which are initially syncing the chain. for this reason the checkpoints included are only as of several years ago.failed verification a one megabyte block size limit was added in 2010 by satoshi nakamoto. this limited the maximum network capacity to about three transactions per second. since then, network capacity has been improved incrementally both through block size increases and improved wallet behavior. a network alert system was included by satoshi nakamoto as a way of informing users of important news regarding bitcoin. in november 2016 it was retired. it had become obsolete as news on bitcoin is now widely disseminated.\\n\\nbitcoin core includes a scripting language inspired by forth that can define transactions and specify parameters. scriptpubkey is used to lock transactions based on a set of future conditions. scriptsig is used to meet these conditions or unlock a transaction. operations on the data are performed by various opcodes. two stacks are used  main and alt. looping is forbidden.\\n\\nbitcoin core uses opentimestamps to timestamp merge commits.\\n\\nthe original creator of the bitcoin client has described their approach to the software's authorship as it being written first to prove to themselves that the concept of purely peertopeer electronic cash was valid and that a paper with solutions could be written. the lead developer is wladimir j. van der laan, who took over the role on 8 april 2014. gavin andresen was the former lead maintainer for the software client. andresen left the role of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. bitcoin core in 2015 was central to a dispute with bitcoin xt, a competing client that sought to increase the blocksize. over a dozen different companies and industry groups fund the development of bitcoin core.\\n\\nhodl (hdl hodl often written hodl) is slang in the cryptocurrency community for holding a cryptocurrency rather than selling it. a person who does this is known as a hodler. it originated in a december 2013 post on the bitcoin forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, i am hodling. it is often humorously suggested to be a backronym to hold on for dear life. in 2017, quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices. thestreet.com referred to it as the favorite mantra of bitcoin holders. bloomberg news referred to it as a mantra for holders during market routs.\\n\\nin charles stross' 2013 science fiction novel, neptune's brood, the universal interstellar payment system is known as bitcoin and operates using cryptography. stross later blogged that the reference was intentional, saying i wrote neptune's brood in 2011. bitcoin was obscure back then, and i figured had just enough name recognition to be a useful term for an interstellar currency it'd clue people in that it was a networked digital currency.\\n\\nthe 2014 documentary the rise and rise of bitcoin portrays the diversity of motives behind the use of bitcoin by interviewing people who use it. these include a computer programmer and a drug dealer. the 2016 documentary banking on bitcoin is an introduction to the beginnings of bitcoin and the ideas behind cryptocurrency today.\\n\\nin september 2015, the establishment of the peerreviewed academic journal ledger (issn\\xa023795980) was announced. it covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the university of pittsburgh. the journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.\\n\\n\""
